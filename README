This software is based on SFMT ver. 1.3.3
(SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne Twister(SFMT))
by 
Mutsuo Saito (Hiroshima University) and
Makoto Matsumoto (Hiroshima University)

* Details of SFMT algorithm is accessible on the Web from:
  http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html

* Tested on FreeBSD/i386 7.3-RELEASE with Erlang/OTP R14A.

* TODO

  * Documentation
  * API functions compatible as the random module
  * C NIFs based on SFMT 1.3.3
    * reference: sfmt-extstate at
      http://github.com/jj1bdx/sfmt-extstate
  * Refactoring of the pure-Erlang code for the sfmt module
    * Note: ++ (lists:append) operators in gen_rand_all_rec2/5
      	    and gen_rand_list32_rec1/6 are still faster than
	    changing them to double lists:reverse/1
