This software is based on SFMT ver. 1.3.3
(SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne Twister(SFMT))
by 
Mutsuo Saito (Hiroshima University) and
Makoto Matsumoto (Hiroshima University)

* Details of SFMT algorithm is accessible on the Web from:
  http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html

* Tested on FreeBSD/i386 7.3-RELEASE with Erlang/OTP R14A.

* API functions compatible as the random module added

* Refactoring Note of the pure-Erlang code:
  ++ (append) operators rewritten by ring buffer loops
  (lists consuming the head elements, and
   the corresponding accumulators)
  This modification made the code ~50% faster

* TODO

  * Documentation

  * C NIFs based on SFMT 1.3.3
